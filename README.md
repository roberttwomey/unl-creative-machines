# Description

This course draws on skills from intermediate coursework in Emerging Media Arts. Students integrate multiple computational tools to create creative machines. Students will learn key ideas from systems art, cybernetics, and computational creativity, and apply these to the development of self-guided projects.

Final projects will demonstrate generative, interactive, and computational techniques at an advanced undergraduate level.

# Course Grading Policy

## Graded activities
- 25% Weekly Exercises – approximately 10 exercises 
- 25% Midterm Project* - proposal, code, documentation, and results must be submitted for credit. 
- 40% Final Project* - proposal, code, documentation, presentation. 
- 10% Participation

*Work will be evaluated on the quality of concept, the degree of experimentation (both aesthetic and technical), and final realization (again, aesthetic and technical). Prompts and rubrics will be provided with more specific details regarding each assignment and breakdowns.

## Description of Assignments and Exams

__*Weekly Exercises*__
Regular small assignments employing tools, techniques, and ideas covered in class. These are short activities with clearly stated creative prompts and technical requirements. Projects will be graded on satisfactory completion with additional credit for creative, technical, expressive extension beyond requirements.

__*Projects*__
We will have one (or more) projects covering concepts from the introductory portion of the class. Each project will have a formal proposal; students will maintain code and design files for their work; students will document their result. Projects will be presented and critiqued in class. Documentation will be submitted for grading. 

__*Final Project, Documentation, and Presentation*__
For the end of the semester you will propose and create a self-directed Creative Machines project engaging tools, materials, and subjects from class. You may build off of examples that excited you from the course, or explore a topic of interest that we have not covered in class. The format, workflow, and submission of this project will follow the process of the midterm. In Week 15 we will have a showcase for these projects, including a short talk and exhibition of the resulting work.  

__*Participation*__
Contributions to class discussions and active participation in critiques and workshops are essential to the momentum of the course and the development of your ideas. This requires that you come to class prepared (having completed assigned reading or exercises), and ready to participate in class activities. Bring finished work for in-class crtiqiues. See the participation evaluation in the Grading Scale below for more information.

## Grading Scale
A+ = 96.67-100 | A = 93.33-96.67 | A- = 90-93.33 <br>
B+ = 86.66-90 | B = 83.33-86.67 | B- = 80-83.33 <br>
C+ = 76.67-80 | C = 73.33-76.67 | C- = 70-73.33 <br>
D+ = 66.67-70 | D = 63.33-66.67 | D- = 60-63.33 <br>
F = below 60%<br>

Here is a description of the kind of participation in the course that would earn you an A, B, C, etc. Your instructor may use pluses and minuses to reflect your participation more fairly, but this is a general description for each letter grade.

A – Excellent 

Excellent participation is marked by near-perfect attendance and rigorous preparation for class work. You respond to questions and activities with enthusiasm and insight and you listen and respond thoughtfully to your peers. You submit assignments on time, adhering to posted requirements, and demonstrate a thorough engagement with the assignment. You respond creatively to any feedback you receive (from both your peers and instructor). You are an active contributor to classroom community. 

  

B – Good<br>
Good participation is marked by near-perfect attendance and thorough preparation for class. You respond to questions with specificity and make active contributions to class. You submit assignments on time, and demonstrate a thorough engagement with the assignment. You respond effectively to the feedback you receive (from both your peers and instructor). You are a regular and reliable contributor to classroom community. 

C – Satisfactory<br>
Satisfactory participation is marked by regular attendance and preparation for class. You respond to questions when prompted and participate in classroom activities, though you may sometimes be distracted. You are present in class, with few absences, and have done some of the work some of the time. You submit assignments and make some efforts toward revision proposals and final submission. You are involved in classroom activities, but you offer minimal feedback and you may not always contribute fully to classroom community.

D – Unsatisfactory<br>
Unsatisfactory participation is marked by multiple absences from class and a consistent lack of preparation. You may regularly be distracted by materials/technology not directly related to class. You submit late or incomplete work. You are absent for classroom activities, or do not work cooperatively in collaborative environments. 

F—Failing<br>
Failing participation is marked by excessive absences, a habitual lack of preparation, and failure to engage in classroom activities and development processes.

# Policies

Course-specific policies and rules.

[Attendance](#attendance) | [Late Work](#late-work) | [Other People's Code](#other-peoples-code) | [UNL Course Policies and Resources](#unl-course-policies-and-resources)

## Attendance
On-time attendance is required as well as work inside and outside of section. Please notify your instructor in advance if you must be absent for illness or family emergency. Any absences must be cleared with the instructor, or justified with written documentation (e.g. letter from team, etc.). We do not differentiate between mental and physical health and in either case please be in communication for when you need to take a day off. After a student misses a week’s worth of classes each subsequent missed class will result in the reduction of the final grade by a full letter grade (i.e., A to B, B- to C-) Excessive tardiness or leaving early will also impact your grade and will follow the same rubric.

Please also note the JCSTF attendance policy:
- 4.7 Attendance Policy
- 4.7.1 After a student misses an equivalent of one week’s worth of classes, each subsequent missed
class will result in the reduction of the final grade by a full letter grade (i.e., A to B, B- to C-).
- 4.7.2 Students may be granted an excused absence at the instructor’s discretion.
- 4.7.3 Students may be granted an excused absence, at the instructor’s discretion, to allow those students to participate in extra-curricular events representing the University. In such cases, the instructor must be notified in advance.
- 4.7.4 This policy, as approved by the faculty, represents the minimum requirement. Faculty members are permitted to develop more stringent attendance requirements, as long as those requirements are detailed in writing in the class syllabus and distributed at the beginning of each course.
- 4.7.5 The policy on students who are late to class will be left up to the individual instructors.

## Late Work
An assignment may receive an F if a student does not participate in every phase of the development of the project and meet all deadlines for preliminary materials (proposals, drafts, work in progress, etc.). Failure to submit any of the graded course assignments is grounds for failure in the course. If a final draft or project, plus required addenda, is not submitted in class on the date due, it will be considered late and will lose one 5% for each day or part of a day past due (A to B, etc.). Assignments are due in class and via online submission, as specified in assignment descriptions. Any late submissions must be approved by your faculty instructor well in advance of the due date.

## Other People's Code
We will use many open source projects to make our work. It is ok to use others' code. However, **you need to cite your sources**, and **you need to do transformative work/make it your own**.
